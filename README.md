# Sales-Prediction---Feature-Engineering

## BigMart Sales Prediction

**Acknowledgements**

I would like to express my gratitude to the data scientists and analysts at BigMart for providing the sales data and insights that made this project possible. Special thanks to the contributors of the open-source libraries and tools that facilitated our analysis and model development.

**Description**

The BigMart Sales Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate the sales of various products across different stores. The dataset consists of sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores located in various cities, along with specific attributes related to each product and store. The primary goal is to identify the key features that influence product sales and to build a robust model that can accurately predict sales figures based on these features.

**Used By**

This project can be leveraged by various stakeholders within the retail and business sectors, including:

* *Retail Executives*: To make strategic decisions regarding product assortment, pricing strategies, and promotional campaigns based on sales predictions.
* *Supply Chain Managers*: To optimize inventory levels and manage stock replenishment effectively, ensuring that popular products are always available.
* *Marketing Teams* : To tailor marketing strategies and campaigns based on predicted sales trends, enhancing customer engagement and driving sales.
* *Financial Analysts* : To forecast revenue and assess the financial impact of different sales strategies and market conditions.
* *Store Managers* : To make informed decisions about product placement and local promotions, maximizing sales opportunities in their specific locations.
* *Business Development Teams*: To identify potential growth areas and new market opportunities based on sales performance insights.
  
**Tech Stack**

*Programming Language* : Python
  
*Libraries*:

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* NumPy: For numerical computations.
  
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
  
* Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

* Statsmodels: For statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
  
*Development Environment*: Jupyter Notebook

*Version Control*: Git

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project includes:

1. *Product Attributes*: Information about the products such as category, brand, and other relevant features.

2. *Store Attributes*: Details about the stores including location, type, and size.

3. *Sales Data*: Historical sales figures for each product at each store.

**Methodology**

* *Data Preprocessing* : Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
* *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Analyzing the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between features and sales.
* *Feature Engineering*: Creating new features that may enhance the predictive power of the model.
* *Model Selection*: Evaluating different machine learning algorithms to find the best fit for the sales prediction task.
* *Model Training and Evaluation*: Training the selected model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics.
* *Prediction*: Using the trained model to predict sales for each product at each store.

**Results**

The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting sales and to deliver a predictive model that can be used for future sales forecasting. The results will be presented in a comprehensive manner, including visualizations and performance metrics.

**Conclusion**

The BigMart Sales Prediction project serves as a valuable resource for understanding retail sales dynamics and leveraging data-driven approaches to enhance business performance. The insights gained from this project can help BigMart and similar retailers optimize their operations and improve sales outcomes.

**Future Work**

Future enhancements may include:

* Incorporating additional data sources such as seasonal trends and economic indicators.
* Implementing advanced machine learning techniques such as ensemble methods or deep learning.
*Developing a user-friendly application for real-time sales predictions.
